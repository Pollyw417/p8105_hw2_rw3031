### import and tidy the NYC transit dataset 

```{r}
subway = 
  read_csv("./NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv")|>
  janitor::clean_names()|>
  select(line:entry, vending, ada)|>
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, "YES" = TRUE ,"NO" = FALSE))
```
The subway dataset contains variables including: `r names(subway)`.

For cleaning up the data, I convert the format of all of the column names into lower case and connected through underscore. I have retain the variables that we are interested in and convert the entry column into a logical variable. 

There are `r ncol(subway)` columns and `r nrow(subway)` rows. The data is tidy now.
